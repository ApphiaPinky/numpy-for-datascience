# NumPy in Data Science

This repository contains examples and explanations of how NumPy, a fundamental library in Python, is used in real-world data science applications.


NumPy is a powerful library in Python used for numerical computing. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object and tools for working with these arrays. NumPy is the foundation of the Python scientific computing ecosystem and serves as the base for many other scientific libraries.
NumPy (Numerical Python) is an open-source library in Python that provides support for arrays, matrices, and a large collection of mathematical functions to operate on these data structures. It's the foundation of the scientific computing stack in Python, serving as a key component in a wide range of data science, machine learning, and scientific computing workflows.
